# Nuclear

We have several examples on [the website](http://alloyteam.github.io/Nuclear/).

a react-like library without jsx , virtual dom and requestAnimationFrame :)

Nuclear used js , html+css and observejs instead of jsx , virtual dom and requestAnimationFrame.

Nuclear Performance test ：[http://alloyteam.github.io/Nuclear/pt/](http://alloyteam.github.io/Nuclear/pt/). There is a lot of room for improvement and optimization.
